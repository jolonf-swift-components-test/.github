# Swift Components Test

This is an organization to test the automatic creation of GitHub repositories by AI agents.

A script will attempt to generate 1000 GitHub repos.

## More Information

The goal is for AI to be able to create software that is highly reusable.

To do this, AI needs to have the ability to create many independent small repos which contains reusable components.

The current test is to see if GitHub is capable of handling this.

There are two possible issues that could arise:
- Rate limits
- Acceptable use policy
